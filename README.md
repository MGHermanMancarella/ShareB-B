Yard Hoppers - An Innovative Backyard Rental Platform

Credit to my co-creator CodingHobo! This would not look nearly as good as it does without you!

This is a pure API app, taking values from the query string (GET requests) or from a JSON body (other requests). 

It returns JSON.

This gets authentication/authorization with JWT tokens.

To run the server on your local drive, clone the repo to your computer and run:

## npm install
## nodemon server.js  

"npm install" installs the required dependencies and nodemon runs the server.
